        </header>

        <h4>What are PROGRAMMING LANUAGES?</h4>
 
        <p>A programming language is a way for programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. Programming languages consist of a set of rules that
           allows string values to be converted into various ways of generating machine code,or, in the case of visual programming languages, graphical 
           elements,There are different types of programming languages which includes. css , python ,c++ and so on, but minf you HTML is not a programming.</p>
        
        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

        <p> <b>HTML</b>  means <em><b>Hypertext markup language</b></em>, it is not  describe as a programming language because it only  the standard markup language

            <p><b>C++</b> (said C plus plus) is an object-oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of 
               the evolution of the C family of languages. It was developed as a cross-platform improvement of C to provide developers with a higher 
               degree of control over memory and system resources.</p>
